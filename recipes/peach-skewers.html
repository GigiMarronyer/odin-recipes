    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is the perfect marriage of sweet and savory flavors, with the perfect kick of spice. Grilling the peaches and red onion play up their sweetness and adds smoky undertones. You can either use an indoor grill pan or fire up the outdoor grill for this recipe!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tofu</strong>: It’s important to use <strong>extra-firm (or “super-firm”)</strong> tofu for this recipe. The firmer the tofu, the less moisture you need to press out of it. And less moisture = “meatier”, crispier cubes!</li>
            <li><strong>Peaches</strong>: You need two ripe peaches (or nectarines) for this recipe.</li>
            <li><strong>Red Onion</strong>: I love adding red onion to any skewer situation. It adds the perfect bite and really elevates the flavor, without being as brash as its white or yellow counterparts.</li>
            <li><strong>Spices</strong>: The spices are quite versatile, however I love a mix of <strong>chili powder, granulated garlic, and ground ginger</strong>. You can also add some paprika, cumin, and black pepper, if you prefer.</li>
            <li><strong>Chili glaze</strong>: This SUPER simple, yet wildly flavorful glaze really makes the recipe sing. It’s a mix of sweet red chili sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, and fresh cilantro— that’s it!</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Slice the Tofu, Peaches, and Red Onion</strong>. To start, remove the tofu from the package and drain excess water. Next, wrap the tofu in a clean kitchen tofu and place on a cutting board. Press on all sides of the wrapped tofu to remove as much moisture as possible. Alternatively, place a heavy skillet over tofu and let sit for 15 minutes. Slice the tofu into 1 to 1 1/2-inch cubes. Next, slice the peaches in half at the seam, and twist to release each half from the pit. Remove and discard the pit. Slice each half into 1-inch cubes (close in size to the tofu). Peel and slice the red onion into similar sized pieces (I like to keep them in groups of 3, so the thickness matches that of the peaches and tofu).</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare and Season the Skewers</strong>. In a small bowl, combine chili powder, garlic powder, ground ginger, and salt; mix well. Thread the tofu, peaches, and red onion onto the skewers, starting with the tofu and ending with red onion. (I use three pieces of each per skewer.) Next, brush the tofu, peaches, and red onion with oil, and sprinkle the seasoning mixture evenly over the skewers, turning to season all sides.</li>
            <li><strong>Grill the Tofu Skewers</strong>. Prepare the outdoor grill or an indoor grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush the grill’s grates with oil, and place the tofu kebabs on the grill. Cook until the tofu is lightly charred, turning occasionally, about <strong>8 minutes</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Brush on Sweet Chili Sauce</strong>. Combine sweet red chili sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, and cilantro in a small bowl. During the final two minutes of grilling, brush the glaze onto the tofu skewers, turning to coat all sides. Finally, remove the tofu skewers from the grill, and garnish with lime zest!</li>
